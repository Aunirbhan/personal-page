                <p>Within ASC I continued to learn new aspects of coding to follow my passion. I developed several skills including differnet languages and technologies. This includes JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, p5.js, and  Git. Additionally, this program taught me many teamwork skills when it comes to working on group projects efficiently.</p>

                <p>Through SAHYC I worked in a group to promote AAPI stories and cultures. I participated in several projects where my group and I brought attention to the beauty in AAPI culture and the importance of teaching Ethnic Studies in schools. All in all, the program was taught me a lot about the importance of perspective and was a great experience.</p>

                <p>Code Nation is a program I attend every Wednesday where I practice coding with coders from American Express. So far, I have learned a lot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also worked on many projects including a BuzzFeed Quiz and Playlist.</p>
