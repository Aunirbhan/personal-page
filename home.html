            <p class="answer">My name is Aunirbhan Das. Although, both my parent's immigrated from Bangladesh, I was born and raised in Queens, New York. I am now 16 and entering my junior year at The Baccalaureate School for Global Education.</p>

            <h3 class="paragraph_descriptors">What Am I Interested In?</h3>
            <br>
                <p class="answer">There are several things I am interested in. One of my primary interests is programming. I started coding in my sophmore year Computer Science class. In the class I realized that not only do I enjoy writing code, but the industry offers a lot of financial freedom. Therefore, my interest in code only kept growing to the point where my future job will probably be as a Computer Scientist or Engineer. Some of my smaller hobbies and interests are sports, photography, and cooking. I find a lot of relaxation and freedom in all of these things. I consider them my creative outlet. I am open to trying new things that force me to focus while keeping me entertained. Finally, one of the simplest pleasures in my day to day life are my daily walks where I can appreciate my neighborhood with some amazing music playing. </p>
